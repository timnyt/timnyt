## Hello there ðŸ‘‹!

My name is Tim and I'm a recent graduate of the QMSS (Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences) Master's program at Columbia University. In a past life, I was a graduate student in Philosophy. Now, my focus, although still somewhat related, revolves around social problems that can be solved with the use of data science.
